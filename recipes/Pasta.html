    <p>
       <u><b>  Ingredients</b></u> 
        <br>
        <br>
        8 ounces (about 225 grams) of pasta (spaghetti, penne, or any type you prefer) <br>
        4 cloves of garlic, minced <br>
        4 tablespoons of butter <br>
        1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese <br>
        Salt and black pepper to taste  <br>
        Fresh parsley or basil for garnish (optional) <br>
        <br>
        <br>
       <u> <b>Instructions</b></u> 
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Cook the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a <br>
        Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions<br>
        until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of <br>
        the pasta water.
        
        Prepare the Garlic Butter Sauce: In a large skillet,melt the <br>
        butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for <br>
        1-2 minutes until fragrant. Be careful not to let the garlic <br>
        burn.
        
        Combine Pasta and Sauce: Add the cooked pasta to the skillet  <br>
        with the garlic butter sauce. Toss well to coat the pasta     <br>
        evenly with the sauce. <br>
        
        Add Cheese: Gradually sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese     <br>
        over the pasta, tossing continuously until the cheese is melted <br>
        and forms a creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, you can <br>
        add some of the reserved pasta water to thin it out. <br>
        
        Season and Garnish: Season the pasta with salt and black pepper <br>
        to taste. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or basil if desired. <br>
        
        Serve: Transfer the garlic and cheese pasta to serving plates <br>
         or bowls. You can sprinkle extra Parmesan cheese on top if you <br>
         like. Serve hot and enjoy! <br>
